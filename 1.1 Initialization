Initialization in QASM256 is straightforward and allows for flexibility in defining quantum states. It includes support for single-qubit, multi-qubit, and entangled state initialization.

Syntax:

INIT |ψ> AS Q[n];  


|ψ>: Represents the desired initial state.
Q[n]: Specifies the qubit or register to initialize.

Initialize a single qubit to state |0>:
INIT |0> AS Q[1];  

Initialize an entire register to |+> (superposition)
INIT |+> AS Q[1 TO 5];  

Prepare a Bell state
INIT |BELL> AS Q[1, 2];
